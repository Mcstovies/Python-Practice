# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each mes-
# sage should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
# person’s name

people = ['Adam', 'Lauren', 'Charlie', 'Lewis']
message = f'Hey {people[0]}, how are you?'
print(message)
message = f'Hey {people[1]}, I love you!'
print(message)
message = f'Hey {people[2]}, Want to play Runescape?'
print(message)
message = f'Hey {people[3]}, YOU ARE THE BEST BOY!'
print(message)
